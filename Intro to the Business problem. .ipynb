This contractor provides places such as: Different types of Restaurants, Bakery, Breakfast Spot, Brewery and Caf\u00e9 with fresh and high-quality groceries. The contractor wants to build a warehouse for the groceries it buys from villagers and farmers inside the borough, so that they will support more customers and also bring better \"Quality of Service\" to the old customers. \n### For example, if the warehouse is close to those old and famous restaurants, then the vegetables and other groceries would be delivered to the restaurant in the right time and there would be no delay so the restaurant cooks can start their job from the morning and the Quality of Service will be high and this contractor will gain more reputation and income.\n### The contractor should build this warehouse where it is closest to its customers in order to minimize the cost of transpotation in addition to the example above. which neighborhood (in that borough) would be a better choice for the contractor to build the warehouse in that neighborhood. Finding the right neighborhood is our mission and our recommender system will provide this contractor with a sorted list of neighborhoods in which the first elemnt of the list will be the best suggested neighborhood.\n",
